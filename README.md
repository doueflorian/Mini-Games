# Mini Games

This is a Vue.JS Project with which I try to code mini games to gain experience on Vue and Javascript.

This is the first draft for this to see how I should handle things and where I need to think differently and more efficiently.

I'll be updating this for a cleaner and "DRYer" code, rethinking the "Gather the seeds" game to work better.
